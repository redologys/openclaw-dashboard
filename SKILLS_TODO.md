# Skills Verification TODO

Checked against `https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills/` on 2026-02-17.

## Verified Paths (found)
- `sophie-optimizer`: `skills/zayresz/sophie-optimizer/SKILL.md`
- `context-anchor`: `skills/boscoeuk/context-anchor/SKILL.md`
- `continuity`: `skills/riley-coyote/continuity/SKILL.md`
- `chaos-mind`: `skills/hargabyte/chaos-mind/SKILL.md`
- `system-monitor`: `skills/zerofire03/system-monitor/SKILL.md`
- `security-monitor`: `skills/chandrasekar-r/security-monitor/SKILL.md`
- `brainrepo`: `skills/codezz/brainrepo/SKILL.md`

## Needs Follow-up
- Requested skill: `public` ("Real-time companion monitor")
- Closest existing path found: `skills/sahanico/molt/web/public/SKILL.md`
- Issue: this `SKILL.md` is `moltfundme` (crowdfunding actions), not a real-time companion monitor.
- Action: keep current `public` path documented and integrated as requested path, but replace with the intended companion-monitor skill once its canonical repo path is provided.
